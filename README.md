 VALVE-EMPLOYMENT-EXAM: ENHANCED EDITION! COMING SOON!!!! 



# VALVE-EMPLOYMENT-EXAM
Impress the GABEN, hallowed be thy name, so that he may bless us with his sales. 
I'm learning c++, this is a exercise in loops, fucntions, and I/O. Please read the main.cpp, 
and give comments on style. I hope you get a good laugh.

The *nix version is pretty straight forward and runs out of the box. just compile the main.cpp file and watch it go.

However the Windows 10 version requires Visual C++ 2015 redistributable x86. It will run on other Windows OSes 7 and 8 but doesn't properly show the victory graphic since this is a console app and it requires the console to be fullscreen.

As soon as I think of some more content to make the trouble worth it, I think Ill make this a openGL app.
